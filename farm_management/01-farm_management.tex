\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Farm management comprises of two words

  \begin{itemize}
  \item "Farm" means a \alert{piece of land} where crops and livestock enterprises are taken up under a \alert{common management} and has specific \alert{boundaries}.
  \item "Management" means the act or art of managing.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Gray\footnote<.->{Introduction to Agricultural Economics, 1924}
  states, the art of managing a farm successfully, as measured by the
  test of profitableness, is called farm management.
\item
  Farm is an economics and social institution
\item
  In a narrow sense, it might refer to the act of daily work supervision
  of farm labour and carrying out the directives of seniors by the
  public and private employed farm managers.
\item
  Broadly, it is also recognized as production economics or agricultural
  economics.
\item
  Farm management is a rational resource allocation proposition,
  particularly from the point of view of an individual farmer.

    On one hand, a farmer has a certain set of farm resources such as
    land, labour, farm building, working capital and farm equipment,
    etc.
  \item
    On other, the farmer has a set of goals/objectives to achieve, may
    be to maximize family satisfaction through increasing net farm
    income.
  \item
    Amidst, farmer him/her-self is limited by the specific degree of
    ability and awareness.
  \item
    Everything must be bridged together

\protect\hypertarget{capital-and-credit}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  One of the four essential factors of production alongside, land,
  labour and enterprise.
\item
  Broadly defined, capital is the money invested in the physical inputs
  used in agricultural production.
\item
  It is needed to purchase or rent productive assets, pay for labor and
  other inputs, and finance family living and other personal
  expenditures. The basic questions to be answered are:
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\tightlist
\item
  How much total capital should be used?
\item
  How should limited capital be allocated among its many potential uses?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Credit is important to capital acquisition and use.
\item
  It is the ability to borrow money with a promise to return the money
  in the future and pay interest for its use.
\item
  The use of credit allows farmers to acquire productive assets and pay
  for them later with the income they generate.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{}
\protect\hypertarget{section-3}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Production process that use a lot of capital relative to labor are
  capital intensive, those that use comparatively little capital are
  labor intensive.
\item
  A firm's asset are its capital -- it may include fixed capital
  (machinery, buildings, and so on) and working capital (stocks of raw
  materials and part-finished products, as well as money used up in
  production process).
\item
  Financial capital includes money, shares and bonds, equity (owner's
  and outside equity)
\item
  Human and social capital are often linked to capital types.
\item
  Capital formation is genereally done through loans in a farm

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Types of loans are based on: length of repayment (short,
    intermediate and long), use of funds (Real estate, non-realestate
    and personal), and types of security pledged (Secured and unsecured)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Land control and use}
\protect\hypertarget{land-control-and-use}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Pending colonisation of the moon, available in fairly fixed supply
\item
  Probably most valuable asset
\item
  A permanent and immobile resource that does not depreciate or wear out
\item
  Marginal increases are possible by reclaiming land from the sea and
  cutting down forests (which may impose large economic costs by
  damaging the environment), but the expansion of deserts may slightly
  reduce the amount of usable land.
\item
  Owners earn money from land by charging rent.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{}
\protect\hypertarget{section-4}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Land is described legally with description of size, location and
  shape.
\item
  The difference in land resources among farms explains why one of the
  first steps in whole-farm planning is to make a complete inventory of
  the land, including soil types, drainage, slope, and fertility.
\item
  Land management includes: Owner managed, leased (Cash share lease,
  crop share lease, labor share lease)
\item
  Under land use, aspects such as farm layout, soil and nutrient
  management, etc. are dealt.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Human resource management}
\protect\hypertarget{human-resource-management}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  It is mobile but limited resource.
\item
  Among the things that determine the supply of labour are the number of
  able people in the population, their willingness to work, labour laws
  and regulations, and the health of the economy and firms.
\item
  Demand for labour is also affected by the health of the economy and
  firms, labour laws and regulations, as well as the price and supply of
  other factors of production.
\item
  In a perfect market, wages (the price of labour) would be determined
  by supply and demand. But the labour market is often far from perfect.
  Wages can be less flexible than other prices; in particular, they
  rarely fall even when demand for labour declines or supply increases.
\item
  This wage rigidity can be a cause of unemployment.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Enterprise}
\protect\hypertarget{enterprise}{}
\begin{itemize}

\item
  An entrepreneur is somebody who has the idea and enterprise to mix
  together the other factors of production to produce something
  valuable.

  They must be willing to take a risk in pursuit of profit.
