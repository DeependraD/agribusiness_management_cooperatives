\begin{frame}{Background}
\protect\hypertarget{background}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  When concerned with resource allocation for production optimization,
  an understanding of input-output or factor-product relationship is
  important.
\item
  First, study of physical or technical relationship is important.
  Second, for decision making, application of economic choice indicators
  such as price ratio is required.
\item
  In a simple scenario, we details the physical factor-product
  relationship of a single variable resoruce and single product.
\item
  Many time resources or capacities of technical units, such as a ropani
  of land or a cow, are fixed and choice is to vary the input of only
  one factor -- such as fertilizer \alertc{OR} labor.
\item
  Other inputs such as fixed capital, buildings, implements and
  technical knowhow remain the same.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{}
\protect\hypertarget{section}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Under such situation question of how much of certain input (amount of
  fertilizer or feed to a cow) to apply arises ?
\item
  This situtation is dealt by single factor-product relationships. a.k.a
  single variable production function (in a production function various
  levels of input are involved with corresponding output of the
  product).
\end{itemize}

\begin{block}{Inputs have several different names:}

functions)}\label{types-of-factor-product-relationships-production-functions}}

\begin{frame}{Types of factor-product relationships (production
functions)}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  There can be three types of input-output relationships in the
  production of a commodity where one input is varied and the quantities
  of all other inputs are fixed.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Constant marginal rate of returns (Constant productivity)
  \item
    Increasing marginal rate of returns (Increasing productivity)
  \item
    Decreasing marginal rate of returns (Decreasing productivity)
  \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Contant marginal rate of returns}
\protect\hypertarget{contant-marginal-rate-of-returns}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Each additional unit of the variable input when applied to fixed
  factors, produces an equal amount of additional product. The amount of
  product increases by the same magnitude for each additional unit of
  input.
\item
  Not a very common relationship in agriculture and holds true only for
  limited range.
\item
  Example:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Addition of one acre of land (technology and other factors being
    same) will add the same amount of product.
  \item
    An addition of one tractor plus driver will do the same amount of
    work as previous tractor driver unit did.

\protect\hypertarget{increasing-marginal-rate-of-returns}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Every additional or marginal unit of input adds more to the total
  product than the previous unit, i.e., addition to total product is at
  an increasing rate.
\item
  In actual practice, the cases of purely increasing returns are rarely
  available except, again, in very limited range.
\item
  This relationship is possible when the fixed factors of production are
  in excess capacity and addition of the small units of a variable
  resource makes more and more efficient use of fixed resources.
\item
  Example:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Small quanity of wheat seed applied when other factors of production
    such as fertilizer, irrigation and other cultural practices can be
    used at high levels will give low returns.

  Since the marginal product (MP) is a measure of rate of change
  therefore:
\item
  When the Total product (TP) is increasing, the MP will be positive.
\item
  When the TP remains constant, the MP will be zero, and
\item
  When the TP decreases, the MP will be negative.
\item
  So long as MP moves upwards or increases, the TP increases at an
  increasing rate.
\item
  When the MP remains constant, the TP increases at a constant rate.
\item
  When the MP starts declining or slopes downward, the TP will be
  increasing at a decreasing rate.

  increasing. This means when the AP is increasing, the MP must be
  greater than the average product.
\item
  As soon as the MP curve goes below the AP curve, the AP curve starts
  decreasing; i.e.~when AP is decreasing, the MP is always less than the

  When AP is equal to MP, at this point AP will be at the maximum. From

As input increase from 1 to 2 units, total output increase from 103 to
174 units. Output thus increases by 71.9 percent in response to input
increase of 100 percent. The elasticity of production is therefore:

\[
\begin{aligned}
E_p &= {\frac{71.9}{100}} \\
&= 0.719

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Essential points to remember in elasticity analysis are:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \tightlist
  \item
    A production function with an elasticity of \(E_p = 1.0\) indicates
    constant returns throughout. This means one percent increase in
    input is always accompanied by one percent increase in output.
  \item
    The elasticity is more than 1.0 up to the point of maximum average
    product where it becomes 1.0.
  \item
    The elasticity is less than 1.0 between the points of maximum
    average product and the maximum total product.
  \item
    When it becomes less than zero, total product declines.
  \item
    When elasticity of production is 1.0, marginal and average products
    are equal. This condition holds true at only one point on the
    classical production function as shown in Figure
    \ref{fig:tc-ac-mc-relationship-plot}.
  \item
    A production function for which the elasticity is less than 1.0
    throughout all ranges of input used will indicate diminishing
    returns.

    e.g., if a farmer operates in this region -- a farmer growing local

\begin{frame}{Why operate in zone II of production function ?}
\protect\hypertarget{why-operate-in-zone-ii-of-production-function}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  When a farmer is undertaking production on his farm, his prime
  objective is to maximize his returns. The TP curve in the production
  function shows only the total production while the MP curve represents
  the rate of returns from production. MP as a measure of farm operation
  efficiency at different level of production is useful to decide how
  much to produce with availabe quantities of input.
\item
  It is of interest to farmer that each additional unit has variable
  relations with quantity of output. One surely will not want to stop
  production when addition of input causes more increment in product
  that the earlier unit of input did. This is the case of Ist zone of
  production function. In this zone efficiency of additional input is
  increasing and the fixed factors of production are not being used upto
  their full potential. To maximize returns from production, it is
  required that input be increased.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{}
\protect\hypertarget{section-13}{}
\begin{itemize}
\item
  As soon as the production from additional one unit of input stops
  adding to the total product, input use beyond this level is wasteful.
  This leads to farmer incurring double loss (first from increased cost
  of input use second from reduced returns from the product itself).
\item
  However, as long as addition to total product is increasing at
  increasing rate or increasing at constant rate, or even increasing at
  decreasing rate, so that cost of additional unit of input use can be
  justified with returns from product obtained by the same additional
  unit of input, the production is carried out. The exact optimum level
  of input use, however, is determined by the price of input and output,
  both.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Knowing the point of operation}
\protect\hypertarget{knowing-the-point-of-operation}{}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In order to determine what level in Region 2 one should operate, one
  needs to know the product as well as the input prices. Multiplying the
  quantities of product and inputs with the respective prices we can
  convert the physical production function into revenue and cost
  functions.
\item
  Thus the optimum level of input use, will be where the additional cost
  of an input is equal to the additional revenue which the input yields.
\item
  Hence in the rational zone of production, factor-product price ratio
  will be used as a choice indicator.

  Take for example Table \ref{tab:fp-relationship-decision-tab}, the
  price per unit of input to be Rs. 4 and price per unit of product Rs.
  3. Multiply the various quantities of product at different levels of
  input-use by Rs. 3. Assuming the producer's purchases are low enough
  not to cause the price of the input to rise, each input unit will cost
  Rs. 4. This is shown in 6th column of the Table
  \ref{tab:fp-relationship-decision-tab}.
\item
  We can see from the Table \ref{tab:fp-relationship-decision-tab} that
  the highest net revenue can be obtained when 8 units of the input are
  used yielding net revenue at Rs 73. If the producer applies less
  number of input units, say 7 units, the net revenue will be less. Here
  the returns from the last unit of input are greater than the costs,
  indicating a scope of further increasing the revenue by pushing up
  input use.

\item
  On the other hand, if inputs are added to the point where the price of
  the input exceeds the value of the marginal product, the added costs
  go greater than the added returns.
\item
  By adding the 9th unit of input, the additional returns will be only
  Rs 3 whereas the cost of this unit of input will be the same Rs 4.
  This means it does not pay the producer to add more than 8 units of
  the input.
\item
  Optimum level of input use will thus be where the value of the
  additional product will be equal to the cost of additional input.

  We can write this condition for maximization of net revenue as:
\end{itemize}

\[
P_{Y1} \Delta Y_1 = P_{X1} \Delta X_1
\]

Where \(P_{Y1} \Delta Y_1\) is added revenue and \(P_{X1} \Delta X_1\)
is added cost.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  This can be written in ratio form as well.
\end{itemize}

\[
\frac{\Delta Y_1}{\Delta X_1} = \frac{P_{X1}}{P_{Y1}}
