The specialized language of economics makes broad use of the word "utility." It means much more than just usefulness. It takes on a meaning of satisfaction, or happiness, or fulfillment. If an object has utility in an economic sense, then it is bringing some kind of reward to its owner or the person who is using it. It is a concept applicable to all goods and services. Food has utility because it keeps people alive. A football game has utility because it entertains the spectators. Social friends have utility because they are there to help or to be helped.

Utility is the satisfaction derived from consuming a good. It is expressed in Utils (hypothetical units of satisfaction derived from consumption of goods or services.)

Cardinal utility

The assignment of specific, but hypothetical, numerical values to the level of satisfaction gained from the consumption of a good. The unit of measurement is the hypothetical util. The early Neoclassical approach was developed by Edgeworth, Sidgwick, Marshall, and Pigou. It assumes the following:

- Utility is scale-measurable by observation or judgment.
- Preferences are exogenously given and stable.
- Additional consumption provides smaller and smaller increases in utility (diminishing marginal utility).
- All individuals have interpersonally commensurable utility functions. With these assumptions, it is possible to construct a social welfare function simply by summing all the individual utility functions. Note that such a measure would still be concerned with the distribution of income (distributive efficiency) but not the distribution of final utilities. The concept of Cardinal utility can be used as a tool to conveniently communicate how consumer behavior works.

Ordinal utility

It is a way of considering consumer satisfaction in which goods are ranked in order of preference: first, second, third, etc. Ordinal preferences do not depend on specific numbers or values. In economics, an ordinal utility function is a function representing the preferences of an agent on an ordinal scale. The ordinal utility theory claims that it is only meaningful to ask which option is better than the other, but it is meaningless to ask how much better it is or how good it is. All of the theory of consumer decision-making under conditions of certainty can be, and typically is, expressed in terms of ordinal utility.

Marginal utility (MU) and Total utility (TU)

The additional amount of satisfaction gained from consuming one more unit of a good and Total Utility (TU) is the cumulative satisfaction received from the entire collection of the good or service.

Marginal Utility (MU) = The change in the level of utility when consumption of a good is increased by one unit.

$$
MU = \frac{\Delta TU}{\Delta Y}
$$

Total Utility (TU) = the total level of satisfaction derived from consuming a given bundle of goods and services.

Applying these concepts to a hypothetical example of consumer behavior enhances understanding. The example here is drinking bottles of cold water after a long, hot day of work. In this case, one major prediction regarding consumer behavior is that "first is best." The first unit of a good consumed yields the most satisfaction. The second unit is less satisfying. Additional satisfaction, or utility, comes from each unit consumed, but typically, the amount of satisfaction from each successive bottle of water diminishes.

## Difference between Tangible and Intangible goods/assets

There are two types of categories of assets called tangible and intangible assets. 

Tangible assets are typically physical assets or property owned by a company, such as computer equipment. Tangible assets are the main type of assets that companies use to produce their product and service. Some examples of tangible assets are:

- Land
- Vehicles
- Equipment
- Machinery
- Furniture
- Inventory
- Securities like stocks, bonds, and cash

Broadly, there are two types of tangible assets: Current Assets, Fixed Assets.

Intangible assets don't exist physically but have a monetary value since they represent potential revenue. A type of an intangible asset could be a copyright to a song. ï»¿The record company that owns the copyright would get paid a royalty each time the song is played. Other kinds of intangible assets are patent and company's brand goodwill.

There are various types of assets that could be considered tangible or intangible, some of which are short-term or long-term assets.

Tangible assets can be damaged by naturally occurring incidence since they are physical assets. Intangible assets are the non-physical assets that add to a company's future value or worth and can be far more valuable than tangible assets. Both of these types of assets are initially recorded on the balance sheet, which helps investors, creditors, and banks assess the value of the company.

Tangible assets are also the easiest to value since they typically have a finite value and life span. Tangible assets are recorded on the balance sheet initially, but as they are used up, they get carried over to the income statement.

Inventory, for example, is a tangible asset that when used, becomes included in the cost of goods sold for a company. Cost of goods sold represents the costs directly involved with the production of a good. As inventory is used up in the production process, it's recorded in cost of goods sold. 

Fixed assets, such as plant and equipment, are the other types of tangible assets that are recorded on the balance sheet but as their useful life is reduced, that portion is expensed on the income statement in a process called depreciation. Depreciation is the process of allocating a portion of the cost of an asset over the years as it is used to generate revenue for the company. Depreciation helps to reflect the wear and tear on tangible assets as they are used during their lifetime.

Intangible assets can be more challenging to value from an accounting standpoint. Some intangible assets have an initial purchase price, such as a patent or license. Similar to fixed assets, intangible assets are initially recorded on the balance sheet as long-term assets.  

The cost of some intangible assets can be spread out over the years for which the asset generates value for the company or throughout its useful life. Whereas depreciation is used for tangible assets, intangible assets use amortization. Amortization is the same concept as depreciation, but it's only used for intangibles. Amortization spreads out the cost of the asset each year as it is expensed on the income statement.

Depending on the type of business, intangible assets may include internet domain names, performance events, licensing agreements, service contracts, computer software, blueprints, manuscripts, joint ventures, medical records, permits, and trade secrets.

In ordinary sense, an intangible good should not be confused with a service since a good is an object, whereas a service is an activity or labor. So a haircut is a service, not an intangible good. A different way to look at this distinction is to consider the ownership factor. In case if person A requests a design and person B fulfills the request and deliver the design through the Internet, was that a service or a digital good? It actually involves both. It's a service that produced an intangible good. If what person A bought from person B is a service, then person A should assume ownership of the design, which is a digital good; whereas if what person A bought is considered an intangible good, then person B may still own the design. It's like when you buy a book from a bookstore, you have the right to use that book but you don't own the copyright, whereas if you hire someone to write a book for you, then you will have the copyright.
